## Before We Start

**What is R and RStudio?** ["R"](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is both a free and open source programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics, and the software for interpreting the code written in the R language. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is an integrative development environment (IDE) within which you can write and execute code, and interact with the R software. It's an interface for working with the R software that allows you to see your code, plots, variables, etc. all on one screen. This functionality can help you work with R, connect it with other tools, and manage your workspace and projects. You don't need RStudio to use R, but many people find that using RStudio makes writing, editing, searching and running their code easier. You cannot run RStudio without having R installed. While RStudio is a commercial product, the free version is sufficient for most researchers.

You can download R for free [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).
You can download RStudio Desktop Open-Source Edition for free [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

**Why learn R?** There are many advantages to working with R. 

* **Scientific integrity.** Working with a scripting language like R facilitates reproducible research. Having the commands for an analysis captured in code promotes transparency and reproducibility. Someone using your code and data should be able to exactly reproduce your analyses. An increasing number of research journals not only encourage, but are beginning to require, submission of code along with a manuscript. 
* **Many data types and sizes.** R was designed for statistical computing and thus incorporates many data structures and types to facilitate analyses. It can also connect to local and cloud databases.
* **Graphics.** R has buit-in plotting functionalities that allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to effectively tell the story of your data.
* **Open and cross-platform.** Because R is free, open-source software that works across many different operating systems, anyone can inspect the source code, and report and fix bugs. It is supported by a large community of users and developers.
* **Interdisciplinary and extensible.** Because anyone can write and share R packages, it provides a framework for integrating approaches across domains, encouraging innovation.   

**Navigating the interface**

The first time you open RStudio, you'll see a window divided into several
panes, like this:

<img src="img/rstudio_start.png">

The exact presentation of the panes might be slightly different depending on your operating system, versions of R and RStudio, and any set preferences. Generally, the panes include:

* **Source** is your script. You can write your code here and save this as a .R file and re-run to reproduce your results. 
* **Console** is where you run the code. You can type directly here, but anything entered here won't be saved when you exit RStudio.
* **Environment/history** lists all the objects you have created (including your data) and the commands you have run. 
* **Files/plots/packages/help/viewer** pane is useful for locating files on your machine to read into R, inspecting any graphics you create, seeing a list of available packages, and getting help.
   
To interact with R, compose your code in the source pane and use the commands execute (or run) to send them to the console. ([Shortcuts](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf): You can use the shortcut Ctrl + Enter, or Cmd + Return, to run a line of code.)

*_Create a script file for today's lecture and save it to your lecture_3 folder under ist008_2022 in your home directory. (It's good practice to keep your projects organized., Some suggested sub-folders for a research project might be: data, documents, scripts, and, depending on your needs, other relevant outputs or products such as figures._*

## Mathematical Operations

R works by the process of "REPL": Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop:

1. R waits for you to type an expression (a single piece of code) and press `Enter`.
2. R then **reads** in your commands and parses them. It reads whether the command is syntactically correct. If so, it will then
3. **evaluate** the code to compute a result.
4. R then **prints** the result in the console and
5. **loops** back around to wait for your next command.

You can use R like a calculator to see how it processes commands. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
7 + 2
```
R always puts the result on a separate line (or lines) from your code. In this case, the result begins with the tag `[1]`, which is a hint from R that the
result is a *vector* and that this line starts with the *element* at position 1. We'll learn more about vectors later in this lesson, and eventually learn
about other data types that are displayed differently.

If you enter an incomplete expression, R will get stuck at the evaluate step and change the prompt to `+`, then wait for you to type the rest of the expression and press the `Enter` key. If this happens, you can finish entering the expression on the new line, or you can cancel it by pressing the `Esc` key (or `Ctrl-c` if you're using R without RStudio). R can only tell an expression is incomplete if it's missing something that it is expecting, like the second operand here: 

```{r echo=T, results='hide', error=TRUE}
7 -
```

Let's do more math! Other arithmetic operators are:

* `-` for subtraction
* `*` for multiplication
* `/` for division
* `%%` for remainder division (modulo)
* `^` or `**` for exponentiation


```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
7 - 2
244/12
2 * 12
```

Arithmetic in R follows an **order of operations** (aka _PEMDAS_): parenthesis, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction. You can combine these and use parentheses to make more complicated expressions, just as you would when writing a mathematical expression. 

For example, to estimate the area of a circle with radius 3, you can write:

```{r}
3.14 * 3^2
```

To see the complete order of operations, use the help command:

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
?Syntax
```

*Tip: You can write R expressions with any number of spaces (including none) around the operators and R will still compute the result. Nevertheless, putting spaces in your code makes it easier for you and others to read, so it's good to make it a habit. Put spaces around most operators, after commas, and after keywords.*


## Variables

Since R is designed for mathematics and statistics, you might expect that it provides a better appoximation for $\pi$ than `3.14`. R and most other programming languages allow you to create and store values called **variables**. Variables allow you to reuse the result of a computation, write general expressions (such as `a*x + b`), and break up your code into smaller steps so it's easier to test and understand. 

R has a built in variable called 'pi' for the value of $\pi$. You can display a variable's value by entering its name in the console:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
pi
```

You can also use variables in mathematical expressions. Here's a more precise calculation of the area of a circle with radius 3:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
pi *3^2
```

You can define your own variables with the assignment operator '=' or '<-'. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, dots `.`, and underscores `_`, but they *cannot* begin with a number. Spaces and other symbols are not allowed in variable names. In general, variable names should be descriptive but concise, and should not use the same name as common (base R) functions like mean, T, median, sum, etc..

Let's make some more variables:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
x <- 10
y <- 24
fantastic.variable2 = x
x<-y/2
```

In R, variables are **copy-on-write**.  When we change a variable (a "write"), R automatically copies the original value so dependent variables are unchanged until they are re-run.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
x = 13
y = x
x = 16
y
```

Why do you think copy-on-write is helpful? Where do you think it could trip you up?


## Calling Functions

R has many **functions** (reusable commands) built-in that allow you to compute mathematical operations, statistics, and perform other computing tasks on your variables. You can think of a function as a machine that takes some inputs and uses them to produce some output. Code that uses a function is said to *call* that function. When you call a function, the values that you assign as input are called **arguments**. The output is called the **return value**. 

We call a function by writing its name followed by a parentheses containing the arguments.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
log(10)
sqrt(9)
```

Many functions have multiple parameters and can accept multiple arguments. For example, the `sum` function accepts any number of arguments and adds them all together. When you call a function with multiple arguments, separate the arguments with commas.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
sum(5, 4, 1)
```
When you call a function, R assigns each argument to a **parameter**. Parameters are special variables that represent the inputs to a function and only exist
while that function runs. For example, the `log` function, which computes a logarithm, has parameters `x` and `base` for the operand and base of the
logaritm, respectively. 

By default, R assigns arguments to parameters based on their order. The first argument is assigned to the function's first parameter, the second to the second, and so on. If you know the order that a function expects to receive the parameters then you can list them separated by commas. Here the argument 64 is assigned to the parameter `x`, and the argument 2 is assigned to the parameter `base`. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
log(64, 2)
```

You can also assign arguments to parameters by name with `=` (but not with `<-`), overriding their positions. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
log(64, base = 2)
log(base = 2, x= 64)
```

*Tip: Both of these expressions are equivalent, so which one should you use? When you write code, choose whatever seems the clearest to you. Leaving parameter names out of calls saves typing, but including some or all of them can make the code easier to understand.*


Not sure what parameters a specific function needs? Read on for how to get...

## HELP! 

This is just the beginning, and there are lots of resources to help you learn more. R has built-in help files that can be accessed with the **`?`** and **`help()`** commands. You can also search within the help documentation using the **`??`** commands. There's also a vibrant online help community. Here are some examples of how you can use all this help to help yourself:

**?** The help pages for all of R's built-in functions usually have the same name as the function itself. Function help pages usually include a brief description, a list of parameters, a description of the return value, and some examples. To open the help page for the `log` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log
```

There are also help pages for other topics, such as built-in mathematical constants (such as `?pi`), data sets (such as `?cars`), and operators. To look up the help page for an operator, put the operator's name in single or double quotes. For example, this code opens the help page for the arithmetic operators:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?"+"
```

*Tip: It's always okay to put single or double quotes around the name of the page when you use `?`, but they're only required if it contains arthmetic commands or non-alphabetic characters. So `?sqrt`, `?'sqrt'`, and `?"sqrt"` all open the documentation for `sqrt`, the square root function. Why does this work?  R treats anything inside single or double quotes as literal text rather than as an expression to evaluate. In programming jargon, a piece of literal text is called a _string_. You can use whichever kind of quotes you prefer, but the quote at the beginning of the string must match the quote at the end. We'll learn more about strings in later lessons when we cover working with unstructured data.*

**??** Sometimes you might not know the name of the help page you want to look up. You can do a general search of R's help pages with `??` followed by a string of search terms. For example, to get a list of all help pages related to linear models:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
??"linear model"
```

This search function doesn't always work well, and it's often more efficient to use an online search engine. When you search for help with R online, include
"R" as a search term. Alternatively, you can use [RSeek][rseek], which restricts the search to a selection of R-related websites.

[rseek]: https://rseek.org/

In later lessons we'll learn about packages, which are sharable bundles of code. You'll often need to look up the documentation to get help figuring out how to work with a new package. You can view a package's help documentation using `packageDescription("Name")`. 


### When Something Goes Wrong (and it will)

Sooner or later you'll run some code and get an error message or result you didn't expect. Don't panic! Even experienced programmers make mistakes regularly, so learning how to diagnose and fix problems is vital. We call this troubleshooting or debugging. 

Stay calm and try going through these steps:

1. If R returned a warning or error message, read it! If you're not sure what the message means, try searching for it online.
2. Check your code for typ0s. Did you capitalize something that should be lower case? Are you missing or have an extra comma, quote, parenthesis?
3. Test your code one line at a time, starting from the beginning. After each line that assigns a variable, check that the value of the variable is what you expect. Try to determine the exact line where the problem originates (which may differ from the line that emits an error!). Sometimes the "shut it down and restart" trick really works - you might have created a variable and forgot about it, and you need a fresh start for the code to work as intended. 

**If all else fails, just Google it.** [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is a popular question and answer website and you can often find solutions to your problems there, or pick up tips to help you tackle your problem in a new way. On CRAN, check out the [Intro to R Manual](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) and [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html). Many regions also have grassroots R-Users Groups that you can join and ask for help. Just remember to pay it forward and use your newfound R prowess to help others in the community on their learning journies!

*Tip: When asking for help, clearly state the problem and provide a [reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html). [R also has a posting guide](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html) to help you write questions that are more likely to get a helpful reply. It's also a good idea to save your `sessionInfo()` so you can show others how your machine and session was configured. Doing this before coming to office hours for a programming class is also highly recommended!*



## Vectors

A **vector** is an ordered collection of values. Essentially everything that you've worked with in R is a vector. The elements in a vector must have the same data type. (While class and type are independent, for vectors they are typically the same and thus you can expect that they typically should have the same class.) You can combine or concatenate values to create a vector using `c()`.
                                                                                                                          
```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
v<-c(5, 4, 4, 12, 10, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 19)
class(v)

logi<-c("woof","woof","cat","woof","woof","cat","woof","woof","woof","woof","woof")
class(logi)

place <- c("Temple", "Yakitori", "Panera", "Yakitori", "Guads", "Home", "Tea List",
  "Raising Canes", "Pachamama", "Lazi Cow", "Wok of Flame")
class(place)
```

What happens if you make a typo or try to combine different data types in the same vector? R resolves this for you and automatically converts elements within the vector to be the same data type. It does so through *implicit coercion* where it conserves the most information possible (logical -> integer -> numeric -> complex -> character). Sometimes this is very helpful, and sometimes it isn't. Here are some examples.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
vec<-c(1,2,3,4,'five')
class(vec)
```

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
vec2<-c(1+TRUE)
vec2
class(vec2)
```


## Data Frames

We frequently work with 2-dimensional tables of data. For a tabular data set, typically each row corresponds to a single subject and is called an observation. Each column corresponds to the data measures or responses -- a feature or covariable. (Sometimes people will also refer to these as variables, but that can be confusing as "variable" means something else in R, so here we'll try to avoid that term.) R's structure for tabular data is the **data frame.**

A data frame is composed of vectors and lists. The columns are vectors and thus are composed of elements of the same data type. The rows are **lists**, and can contain elements of different data types. A data frame can have any number of columns, but every row must be the same length. 

To make a data frame in R, you can combine vectors using the data.frame() command.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
distance.mi <- c(0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 0.6, 2, 100, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1, 3.7)
time.min <- v
major <- c("chicanix studies", "human development", "economics", "undeclared", "psychology", "MMM", "psychology", "undeclared", "human development", "undeclared", "GG")

my.data <- data.frame(place, distance.mi, time.min, major)
```



## Inspecting Data

R has some built in functions to help you inspect vectors.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
length(v)   # returns how many elements are within the object
length(place)
```
Here are a few functions for calucating basic statistics on a vector (we'll go into more detail on statistics during a later lesson):

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
mean(v)   # mean
median(v) # median
sd(v) 		  # standard deviation
```

You can print a small dataset, but it can be slow and hard to read especially if there are a lot of coumns. R has many built in functions to inspect objects:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
head(my.data) # this prints only the beginning of the dataset
tail(my.data) # this prints only the end of the dataset
nrow(my.data) # number of rows
ncol(my.data) # number of columns
ls(my.data) # 
rownames(my.data) # names of the rows
```

Two highly informative functions for inspecting a data frame are **str** and **summary**.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
str(my.data)  
summary(my.data)
```
You can also inspect objects within your data frame. **Factors*** are the class that R uses to represent categorical data. ***Levels*** can be used to return the different categories of a specified factor. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
levels(my.data$major)
```

Data Types & Classes
--------------------

Data can be categorized into different _types_ based on sets of shared
characteristics. For instance, statisticians tend to think about whether data
are numeric or categorical:

* numeric
    + continuous (real or complex numbers)
    + discrete (integers)
* categorical
    + nominal (categories with no ordering)
    + ordinal (categories with some ordering)

Of course, other types of data, like graphs (networks) and natural language
(books, speech, and so on), are also possible. Categorizing data this way is
useful for reasoning about which methods to apply to which data.

In R, data objects are categorized in two different ways:

1. The _class_ of an R object describes what the object does, or the role that
   it plays. Sometimes objects can do more than one thing, so objects can have
   more than one class. The `class` function, which debuted in Section
   \@ref(data-frames), returns the classes of its argument.

2. The _type_ of an R object describes what the object is. Technically, the
   type corresponds to how the object is stored in your computer's memory. Each
   object has exactly one type. The `typeof` function returns the type of its
   argument.

Of the two, classes tend to be more important than types. If you aren't sure
what an object is, checking its classes should be the first thing you do.

The built-in classes you'll use all the time correspond to vectors and lists
(which we'll learn more about in Section \@ref(lists)):

| Class     | Example               | Description
| :----     | :------               | :----------
| logical   | `TRUE`, `FALSE`       | Logical (or Boolean) values
| integer   | `-1L`, `1L`, `2L`     | Integer numbers
| numeric   | `-2.1`, `7`, `34.2`   | Real numbers
| complex   | `3-2i`, `-8+0i`       | Complex numbers
| character | `"hi"`, `"YAY"`       | Text strings
| list      | `list(TRUE, 1, "hi")` | Ordered collection of heterogeneous elements

R doesn't distinguish between scalars and vectors (see Section \@ref(vectors)),
so the class of a vector is the same as the class of its elements:

```{r}
class("hi")
class(c("hello", "hi"))
```

In addition, for ordinary vectors, the class and the type are the same:

```{r}
x = c(TRUE, FALSE)
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

The exception to this rule is numeric vectors, which have type `double` for
historical reasons:

```{r}
class(pi)
typeof(pi)
typeof(3)
```

The word "double" here stands for [_double-precision floating point
number_][double], a standard way to represent real numbers on computers.

[double]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format

By default, R assumes any numbers you enter in code are numeric, even if
they're integer-valued.

The class `integer` also represents integer numbers, but it's not used as often
as `numeric`. A few functions, such as the sequence operator `:` and the
`length` function, return integers. You can also force R to create an integer
by adding the suffix `L` to a number, but there are no major drawbacks to using
the `double` default:

```{r}
class(1:3)
class(3)
class(3L)
```

Besides the classes for vectors and lists, there are several built-in classes
that represent more sophisticated data structures:

| Class      | Description
| :----      | :----------
| function   | Functions
| factor     | Categorical values
| matrix     | Two-dimensional ordered collection of homogeneous elements
| array      | Multi-dimensional ordered collection of homogeneous elements
| data.frame | Data frames

For these, the class is usually different from the type. We'll learn more about
most of these later on.


### Lists

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#earn = read.csv("data/earn.csv")
```

A _list_ is an ordered data structure where the elements can have different
types (they are _heterogeneous_). This differs from a vector, where the
elements all have to have the same type, as we saw in Section \@ref(vectors).
The tradeoff is that most vectorized functions do not work with lists.

You can make an ordinary list with the `list` function:

```{r}
x = list(1, c("hi", "bye"))
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

For ordinary lists, the type and the class are both `list`. In Section
\@ref(indexing), we'll learn how to get and set list elements, and in later
sections we'll learn more about when and why to use lists.

You've already seen one list, the `my.data` data frame:

```{r}
class(my.data)
typeof(my.data)
```

Under the hood, data frames are lists, and each column is a list element.
Because the class is `data.frame` rather than `list`, R treats data frames
differently from ordinary lists. This difference is apparent in how data frames
are printed compared to ordinary lists.


### Implicit Coercion

R's types fall into a natural hierarchy of expressiveness:

<img src="img/implicit_coercion.png">

Each type on the right is more expressive than the ones to its left. That is,
with the convention that `FALSE` is `0` and `TRUE` is `1`, we can represent any
logical value as an integer. In turn, we can represent any integer as a double,
and any double as a complex number. By writing the number out, we can also
represent any complex number as a string.

The point is that no information is lost as we follow the arrows from left to
right along the types in the hierarchy. In fact, R will automatically and
silently convert from types on the left to types on the right as needed. This
is called _implicit coercion_.

As an example, consider what happens if we add a logical value to a number:

```{r}
TRUE + 2
```

R automatically converts the `TRUE` to the numeric value `1`, and then carries
out the arithmetic as usual.

We've already seen implicit coercion at work once before, when we learned the
`c` function. Since the elements of a vector all have to have the same type, if
you pass several different types to `c`, then R tries to use implicit coercion
to make them the same:

```{r}
x = c(TRUE, "hi", 1, 1+3i)
class(x)
x
```

Implicit coercion is strictly one-way; it never occurs in the other direction.
If you want to coerce a type on the right to one on the left, you can do it
explicitly with one of the `as.TYPE` functions. For instance, the `as.numeric`
(or `as.double`) function coerces to numeric:

```{r}
as.numeric("3.1")
```

There are a few types that fall outside of the hierarchy entirely, like
functions. Implicit coercion doesn't apply to these. If you try to use these
types where it doesn't make sense to, R generally returns an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
sin + 3
```

If you try to use these types as elements of a vector, you get back a list
instead:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, sum)
class(x)
```

Understanding how implicit coercion works will help you avoid bugs, and can
also be a time-saver. For example, we can use implicit coercion to succinctly
count how many elements of a vector satisfy a some condition:

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, -1, 10, -2, 3, 8, 2)
condition = x < 4
sum(condition)    # or sum(x < 4)
```

If you still don't quite understand how the code above works, try inspecting
each variable. In general, inspecting each step or variable is a good strategy
for understanding why a piece of code works (or doesn't work!). Here the
implicit coercion happens in the third line.



## Subsetting

Sometimes you will want to work with only specific elements in a vector or data frame. To do that, you can refer to the position of the element, which is also also called the index.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
length(time.min)
time.min[15]
```

You can also subset by using the name of an element in a list. The `$` operator
extracts a named element from a list, and is useful for extracting the columns
from data frames.

How can we use subsetting to look only at the distance response?
 
```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
my.data$distance.mi
my.data[,2]
distances2<-my.data[["distance.mi"]]
distances3<-my.data[[2]]

```

What are the responses for psychology majors?

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
psyc_major <- my.data[which(my.data$major == 'psychology'), ]
View(polisci_majors)

which(my.data$major == "psychology")
shortframe<-my.data[c(4,8,13),]
```

What are the majors of the first 5 students who replied?

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
shortframe2 <- my.data[1:5,"major"]             # range for rows, columns
```

You can also use `$`  to create an element within the data frame.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
my.data$mpm <- my.data$distance.mi / my.data$time.min
```
